The information gathering portion of a penetration test focuses on identifying
the scope of the penetration test. During this penetration test, I was tasked
with exploiting the exam network. The specific IP addresses were:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 192.168.xx.xx
  \item 192.168.xx.xx
  \item 192.168.xx.xx
  \item 192.168.xx.xx
  \item 192.168.xx.xx
\end{itemize}
